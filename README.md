This is a sample project I am using for unit testing Angular in Mocha and Jasmine.

I want to do a user management application. It should have the following features:

1) Organization
        Add
        View (Card and List) both should be inline.
        Update
        Edit

2) Users
        Add
        View (Card and List) both should be inline.
        Update
        Edit
